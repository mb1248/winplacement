winplacement 1.2
is a small tool that move the active window (not only) to the left or right side of your desktop. 

USAGE

You can use several hotkeys to move the window.
Use the win-key and the arrow keys to move the ative window to the left, right, top or bottom of your screen. If you use win+shift+arrow you split the window in the big part of the golden ratio, for the small part use win+ctrl+arrow.
The up and down arrow don't maximized the window, so if you press win+left arrow and win+top arrow your window will be set to the upper left quarter.
Try it. Type winplacement -h for all options.

Copy winplacement in your local ~/bin path.
